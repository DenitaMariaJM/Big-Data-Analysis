  In this project we perform analysis on wednesday_workinghours.pcap file under CICIDS 2017 dataset. This dataset mainly relay on network details like destination ports, flow duration,forward packets etc during a particular day. Here we used tools like DASK to demonstrate scalibilty of this dataset which include analysing the whole data and displaying few required fields like destination port,flow duration etc.It also uses libraries like matplot ,pandas  to print a graphical representation of the analysis where the count of distribution of various traffics was plotted. Thus based on the resulted graph we were able to conclude that BENIGN has highest distribution followed by DoS Hulk.
  
   With this project i was able to know about the practical applications of DASK in analysing network traffics.Also familiarized with python visualization tools like matplot where different graphical analysis be  prepared.
